- 👋 Hi, I’m @RebeccaAHGower
- 👀 I’m interested in finding my previous identity here on GitHub
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a product manager.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on work projects for my employer, possibly other things to do with diabetes or compassion, especially for refugees.
- 📫 How to reach me? Not really looking for much contact here.
